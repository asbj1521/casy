/**
 * Text that rolls when it changes: the old line slides up and out while the
 * new one rises into its place.
 *
 * Used for the group name on the scheduling page, where the example groups
 * change by themselves every few seconds. A name that simply blinked to a different
 * word would read as a glitch; watching it roll makes it obvious that the
 * page is cycling through examples rather than telling you something new.
 *
 * Both lines sit in the same grid cell so they overlap while they cross, which
 * keeps the height fixed and stops the layout jumping on every change. The
 * outgoing line stops taking clicks on its way out, so it can't swallow one
 * meant for what's underneath.
