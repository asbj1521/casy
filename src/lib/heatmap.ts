/**
 * Builds a month calendar grid tinted by availability — the killer visual.
 *
 * It lays out a single calendar month, Monday-first, with leading/trailing days
 * from the neighbouring months padding the grid to whole weeks. For every day in
 * the month we compute how many people are free for a meeting at the chosen
 * time, and the UI tints each day by that count so the best days jump out. Days
 * in the past keep their tint but get dimmed in the UI.
 *
 * Like the engine, this is a pure function over the data model. Days, hours
 * and weekdays are local to the zone it is given (src/lib/zone.ts).
