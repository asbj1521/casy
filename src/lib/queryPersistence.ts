/**
 * Remember a few small server answers across page loads, so a reload shows
 * the last known state at once and refreshes it quietly in the background
 * instead of starting from spinners.
 *
 * Only the queries named in PERSISTED are kept, and on purpose they are all
 * about the signed-in person themself: their groups (names and members),
 * their calendar status and primary calendar, whether they are an admin, and
 * their own resolved display name. Other people's busy times and the admin overview are never
 * written to the device.
 *
 * Every key those queries use includes the user's id, so one person's cache
 * is never served to another; everything is wiped on sign-out anyway (see
 * AuthProvider). A restored answer is marked with the time it was fetched,
 * so React Query still treats an old one as stale and refetches it.
