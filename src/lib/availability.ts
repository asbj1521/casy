/**
 * The availability engine.
 *
 * Everything the product knows about "when can this group meet" lives here,
 * as pure functions over plain numbers (epoch milliseconds). No I/O, no
 * React — deterministic and easy to unit-test, which matters because this is
 * the one piece of logic the entire product depends on being correct.
 *
 * Four searches share one vocabulary:
 *   - findEarliestSlot     a single meeting at a precise time of day
 *   - findEarliestDaySpan  N whole days, the first place they fit
 *   - findBestDaySpan      N whole days, the best-scoring place (vacations)
 *   - findWeeklySpan       a weekday-anchored window, best-scoring occurrence
 *                          (weekend trips)
 * plus findVacationSuggestions, which proposes workarounds when the requested
 * vacation length doesn't work cleanly.
 *
 * Multi-day searches classify busy blocks with two rules:
 *   - HARD blocks (isHardBlock): all-day absences — being on another trip —
 *     rule the day out entirely. Short plans (a dinner, a training night) are
 *     things you'd skip for a trip and don't block at all.
 *   - SOFT blocks (isSoftBlock): work and school don't block, but come back
 *     as conflicts the affected person must approve ("take Friday off?").
 * On top sits the departure-day rule: a soft block on the span's first day
 * ending by 17:00 is no obstacle — you leave in the evening, exactly like a
 * weekend trip starting Friday after work.
 *
 * Each calendar's owner can also set its priority (CalendarPriority), which
 * overrides both rules: a "skip" calendar never blocks anything, and a
 * "never" calendar always blocks, trips included. Single meetings skip "skip"
 * blocks only when waiting for a date nobody skips for would take more than
 * a week (findMeetingSlot).
 *
 * Time zones: blocks and results are instants, but hours, weekdays and whole
 * days are local to the zone each search is given ("18:00" means 18:00 in
 * Copenhagen). Days are stepped with src/lib/zone.ts rather than by adding
 * 24 hours, so the two days a year that are 23 or 25 hours long come out
 * right.
