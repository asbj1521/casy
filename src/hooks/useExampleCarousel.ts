/**
 * The front page's example carousel: which made-up group is on screen, and
 * when it moves on.
 *
 * It exists to answer "what is this for?" for someone who has just arrived and
 * has no groups of their own. A single frozen example says far less than
 * watching a basketball squad, a book club and a family each come up with
 * their own crowded calendar.
 *
 * It stops for good the first time the person touches anything. Content that
 * keeps moving while you are reading it is not a demo any more, it is an
 * interruption: you go to look at a date the search found and it swaps out
 * from under you. Stopping is deliberately permanent rather than a pause,
 * because once someone is using the page they are no longer watching a demo.
 *
 * It also never runs for someone whose system asks for reduced motion.
 * Content that advances on its own is exactly what that setting is about.
