 *
 * Time: the generator reasons in Copenhagen calendar dates and clock times
 * ("Monday, 09:00 to 17:00"). Internally those are kept as "wall-clock ms":
 * Date.UTC(year, month, day, hour), whose UTC fields *are* the local date and
 * time, so day arithmetic stays simple. They only become real instants in
 * `iso()`, where each one is read as Copenhagen time. So work runs 09:00 to
 * 17:00 Danish time in summer and winter alike, as it would in a real
 * calendar.
